# Piano-Hero-Augmented-Reality
Toy project of an Augmented Reality overlay that helps learn any song Synthesia style


## How does it work
Hopefully my messy code explains itself. Basically, download *any song* in MIDI format and change the file name in *main.py*. Select the track with the interesting stuff ('piano' is the most usual). You might want to adjust the speed of the notes to match the song tempo.
